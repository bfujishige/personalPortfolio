website portfolio

This repository contains all of the files related to my web development portfolio.
It also serves as a "website" due to not paying for a domain name, etc..
Total of two projects so far, not including this website.
Each of these projects will be available individually as github repositories.
First project is the Ground Up Coffee Shop website.
Second project is the Frogger-type game, part of a project from Udacity.
